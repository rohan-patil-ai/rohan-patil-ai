## 🎯 What I'm Working On

**Currently:** Teaching computers to find 5×5 pixel bacteria in 150K×60K pixel images.

I specialize in **Computer Vision** and **RAG systems** that solve real problems—whether that's helping veterinary pathologists catch diseases they'd otherwise miss, or helping engineers at BMW find solutions buried in thousands of incident reports.

## 🔬 Research & Impact

<div align="center">

| 🦠 **Active Learning Pipeline** | 🏭 **RAG for BMW** | 🎲 **RL at Scale** | 🚗 **OCR for Production** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **150K×60K px** WSI | **1,000+** documents | **5M** training hands | **5,000+** records/run |
| 41%→50% mAP50 | Semantic search + analytics | +20% over baseline | 85% error reduction |
| Laboklin partnership | BMW quality system | Double Q-Learning | OCR pipeline automation |

</div>

### 🧬 H.Pylori Detection @ Laboklin `In Progress`
Building a hierarchical detection pipeline that outperforms human pathologists. Used active learning to discover **300+ missed annotations** in the first iteration alone. Working with YOLOv8 and R-CNN on whole slide images where the bacteria are literally the size of a few pixels.

**The Challenge:** Imagine playing "Where's Waldo" but Waldo is 5 pixels tall and the image is the size of a football field.

### 🚗 BMW Lessons Learned System `Shipped`
Engineered a RAG system that lets quality engineers semantic-search through incident reports instead of drowning in spreadsheets. Built the entire stack—from ETL pipelines to React dashboards.

**Impact:** Cross-department trend analysis that actually gets used.

### 🃏 Blackjack RL Research `Published`
Trained reinforcement learning agents on millions of hands under realistic casino conditions. Improved natural Blackjack win rates from 2.29% to 2.75%—a 20% gain over baseline Monte Carlo methods. Implemented card counting, rule variations, and house edge analysis.

**Fun Fact:** Still wouldn't recommend trying this in Vegas.
